Which is why I'm surprised you'd wanna bet

Did I ever tell you about this one time

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,166
I actually recruited a Russian assassin
to join my American covert ops team?

23

I'm not afraid of a big swing.

access the database yesterday?

309
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:44,541
You won't win. Not against me.
Not against S.H.I.E.L.D.

ROMANOFF: (OVER PHONE)
<i>It's Hope! It's all about Hope!</i>

316
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,875
<i>It's Hope! It's all about Hope!</i>

COULSON: Four hours to sunup, sir.

319
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,625
I haven't forgotten.

320
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:46,250
Sir, I understand that this
Prince Loki situation is the very reason

321
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,291
you proposed the Avengers Initiative

322
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,583
for a group of remarkable individuals
to fight the battles we can't.

323
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,750
I wrote the speech.

324
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,583
There's still one name left, sir.

325
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,208
Yours.

326
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,416
I'm not the only Avenger left.

327
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,125
What?

328
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,083
COULSON: Is that a beeper from the '90s?

329
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,583
Also our last hope.

330
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:30,666
"Hope. It's all about Hope."

331
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,416
(CHUCKLES) Widow.

332
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,791
COULSON: Boss?

333
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,541
-Where are you going?
-Not sure.

334
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:46,250
Either make a pact
with a god or deal with a devil.

335
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,833
You got a name, soldier?

336
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,333
I'm here to see your boss.

337
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,750
If it isn't Hank Pym.

338
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:43,625
HANK: The balls you have to come here
and stand over her grave.

339
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:44,958
Oh, don't worry about her.

340
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,625
I doubt she'd mind,
considering she's dead.

341
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:51,166
She died because S.H.I.E.L.D. killed her.

342
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,375
She died because of you.

343
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:58,958
Agent Hope Van Dyne was killed
on a mission outside Odessa, Ukraine.

344
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,291
Agent?

345
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:03,375
She was my daughter! My little girl.

346
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:06,750
She missed her mother
and you exploited that!

347
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,750
Her mother was an agent?

348
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,583
Don't play the fool with me, Fury.

349
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:17,500
You filled her head with nonsense about
protecting humanity and saving the world.

350
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:21,625
You just left out how she died
the same way her mother did,

351
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,666
doing S.H.I.E.L.D.'s dirty work!

352
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,625
And that gave you
permission to murder them?

353
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:33,000
Anthony Stark? Clint Barton?
Bruce Banner? Natasha Romanoff?

354
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:36,083
You took everything from me.

355
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,166
<i>I wanted you to hurt.</i>

356
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:46,833
<i>To witness everything</i>
<i>you've ever worked for...</i>

357
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,416
<i>fought for...</i>

358
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,666
<i>hoped for...</i>

359
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,083
<i>die.</i>

360
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:02,166
And what of Thor, Prince of Asgard?

361
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,833
Goldilocks? You would have
recruited him in a heartbeat.

362
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:09,250
Sold him some malarkey about being a hero.

363
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:12,708
That's what you do.
What S.H.I.E.L.D. has always done.

364
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,625
Find others to fight your battles.

365
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,416
That's it?
You murdered him because you could?

366
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,125
His death was a favor.
Yours will be a triumph.

367
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:36,250
What the...

368
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:39,875
You're still pretty spry
for a guy with a corner office.

369
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,750
You never cared about Hope.

370
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:52,750
I don't give a damn about any of them.

371
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,333
-(FURY LAUGHS)
-(GRUNTS)

372
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,708
Fury! Come on.

373
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:07,625
You're supposed to be a killer?
Well, come on, then. Kill me.

374
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,833
-(GASPS)
-Ooh.

375
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:16,375
HANK: How are you...

376
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:19,041
-(FURY LAUGHING)
-Stop moving, Fury.

377
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:21,125
What are you doing? Let's go--

378
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:23,875
It's like you're everywhere. Aah!

379
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,208

(ALL LAUGHING)

381
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:53,916
Uh, what's with the goth kid?

382
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,416
Hello. Trickster God. Hi.

383
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,791
S.H.I.E.L.D. is people,

384
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:02,541
people willing to give their lives
for something greater than themselves

385
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:06,458
to save the world from men like you.

386
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,375
Agent Hope Van Dyne understood that
and she will never be forgotten.

387
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:17,458
Then you honor her.

388
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,250
Then honor her.

389
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:25,375
Well, this was
an absolute pleasure, Director Fury.

390
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,166
Good. Now take your hammer
and get off my planet.

391
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,500
(CHUCKLES) About that,
we should be allies.

392
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,500
You know, I've just had an idea.

393
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:36,833
I was thinking I might extend
my stay here on Midgard.

394
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,000
For how long?

395
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)

396
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,750
Good evening, my loyal subjects.

397
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:58,750
It is with great pride
that I stand before you today

398
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,416
to announce that in just one day's time,

399
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,083
the nations of Earth
have put aside their differences

400
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:08,416
and united under my command.

401
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,416
<i>It's the unspoken truth of humanity</i>
<i>that you crave subjugation.</i>

402
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,000
<i>The bright lure of freedom hobbles you,</i>
<i>diminishes your life's joy.</i>

403
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:20,291
<i>You were made to be ruled.</i>

404
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:27,125
So I have come
to help you fulfill your destiny.

405
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:36,458
The Avengers fell
before they had a chance to rise.

406
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:38,000
May they rest in peace.

407
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,083
They can, but we won't.

408
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:44,666
The Avengers were always
meant to be more than a team.

409
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,291
They were an idea,

410
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:52,333
the affirmation of humanity's need
to believe that in our darkest hour,

411
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:55,583
we will find our heroes.

412
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:03,666
<i>I believe that in this universe,</i>
<i>as in every other, hope never dies.</i>

413
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:09,833
<i>As long as someone keeps</i>
<i>their good eye on the bigger picture.</i>

414
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:12,833
Welcome back, Captain.

415
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,541
So where's the fight?
